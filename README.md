GridEye USB Board
=================

This board is designed to allow a USD host to connect to a Panasonic GridEye sensor.

The files were generated by and can be opened by KiCad.

This is version 1 of the board. The PCBs have been sent off to be fabricated, grideye_usb_two_sided_gerbers.zip contains a set of gerbers suitable for use by OSHPark.

The design **probably** does not work. The parts have never been placed on the board, the board has never been powered up, no firmware has been written... the availability of this design should be considered an academic curiosity, not something to use.
